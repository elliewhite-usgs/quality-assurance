# README

This repo keeps track of documents writtent for my own personal knowledge management and to serve as part of a bigger quality assurance plan for USGS IIDD in FY 2024.

* `Collaborative project constitution`: written to standardize language and minimize differences without distinctions. The document promotes standard naming conventions, tagging, and provides project-specific guidelines in producing data dictionaries. The document serves dual purposes: Firstly, it acts as a guiding framework, aiding developers in writing code harmoniously and achieving a more cohesive product. Secondly, it serves as a cultural touchstone for the project, setting a definitive tone and establishing the rules of operation within the software development environment. It encapsulates the accumulated wisdom and shared values of the development team, providing a reference point for decision-making and code-related discussions. By outlining the accepted norms and expectations for code style, architecture, documentation, and collaboration, it ensures a shared understanding and fosters a cohesive developer culture.

* `Predictive modeling quality assurance plan`: written to outline the modeling “commandments” or best practices that help avoid ineffective experimental designs, inappropriate analyses, and flawed reasoning.

* `Data visualization quality assurance plan`: written to outline best practices that ensure accurate, effective, and meaningful communication of data insights for all users and to help avoid bias, misinterpretation, and misleading conclusions. This plan [in progress] outlines how to achieve 508 compliance, which requires federal agencies make their electronic and information technology (EIT) accessible to individuals with disabilities.

* `Mural/` folder contains whiteboard type visioning that facilitated discussions in these areas.
